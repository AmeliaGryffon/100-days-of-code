# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 31, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I wrote a calculator app with React

**Thoughts:** Using the mathjs libraries evaluate function made calculating values easy. I probably didn't need to make the keypad and caclulator separate components but I felt it kept the code more organized.
