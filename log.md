# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 31, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I wrote a calculator app with React

**Thoughts:** Using the mathjs libraries evaluate function made calculating values easy. I probably didn't need to make the keypad and caclulator separate components but I felt it kept the code more organized.

### Day 2: June 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I started on a small app that tracks taking meds.

**Thoughts:** CSS flexbox gave me a bit of trouble but I worked it out. I decided to use SVG instead of font-awesome icons because I haven't worked with those before, as it turns out the best way to use an svg is to make it's own react component. I have not finished the app but I will by tomorrow.

### Day 3: June 3, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I've nearly finished the med tracker app.

**Thoughts:** Momentjs made tracking time way easier that calculating based on the built in JavaScript. Keeping track of data was hard especially since I need to calculate on the highest level component using data from the lowest level ones. It took a couple iterations but I finally got to the solution.

I didn't post on the second because unfortunately life got in the way, but I'm back on track now.

**Today's Progress**: I've have finished the med tracker app.

### Day 5: June 6, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I started working with ExpressJs to make an API. 

**Thoughts:** GThis is the first time I've tried to do make anything back-end. Not entirely sure what this is going to end up being, but I'm learning a lot about HTTP requests.

**Link to work:** (Will post link once I've made enough progress I feel comfortable to upload to github)

### Day 6: June 7, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I practiced JS on JSChallenger 

**Thoughts:** This website has a lot of good practice questions, though the functions they have you write are short one liners.
